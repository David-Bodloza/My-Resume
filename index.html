    <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
    <p>
        I pride myself on being a goal-oriented individual. I work well in a team environment and use my
        initiative. Although I know that my previous work experience does not align with the position I am applying for,
        I have discovered that the principle remains the same (Customer Service). I aim to use my strong organizational
        skills and educational background to become competent from anywhere in the world.
